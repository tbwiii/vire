A simple web app to kick off rounds of the Movie Game.

The Movie Game is a party game. Players take turns going in a circle naming an actor or movie accociated with the previous player's answer.

## For example

If a player names "Tom Cruise", the next player must name a movie that Tom Cruise was in such as "Top Gun".
The third player must name an actor or actress from "Top Gun" and so on.

This goes on until a player cannot produce a correct answer and recieves a strike. Each player is allowed 3 strikes before being out of the game.

The last person remaining wins.

## Purpose

The app is used to get new rounds started with easy actors and movies.
